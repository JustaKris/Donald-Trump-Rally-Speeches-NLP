## üéØ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Poetry for dependency management
- 2GB+ disk space for model weights

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/JustaKris/Donald-Trump-Rally-Speeches-NLP.git
   cd Donald-Trump-Rally-Speeches-NLP
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with Poetry**
   ```powershell
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```powershell
   poetry shell
   ```
   
   Or use the .venv directly:
   ```powershell
   & ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Lab**
   ```powershell
   poetry run jupyter lab
   ```

5. **Run notebooks in order**
   - Start with `1. Word Clouds.ipynb` (creates shared dataset)
   - Then `2. Sentiment Analysis.ipynb` (adds sentiment features)
   - Finally `3. Masked Language Modeling.ipynb` (optional deep dive)

### First-Time Setup

Some notebooks require NLTK data. Run once in a notebook cell:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## üì¶ Core Dependencies

```toml
python = "^3.12"
numpy = "^2.1.3"
pandas = "^2.2.3"
matplotlib = "^3.9.2"
seaborn = "^0.13.2"
wordcloud = "^1.9.4"
nltk = "^3.9.1"
plotly = "^5.24.1"
transformers = "^4.46.3"
tensorflow = "^2.18.0"
tqdm = "^4.67.0"
datasets = "^3.1.0"
```

**Note**: TensorFlow installs CPU-only by default. For GPU support, follow [PyTorch's official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the appropriate CUDA-enabled version.

## üéì Learning Outcomes & Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates capabilities that are directly applicable to industry roles:

### For Data Science Roles
- End-to-end analysis from raw text to insights
- Statistical rigor and proper evaluation methods
- Clear communication of findings

### For ML Engineering Roles
- Working with state-of-the-art transformer models
- Efficient data processing pipelines
- Model fine-tuning and deployment considerations

### For Analytics Roles
- Interactive visualization best practices
- Temporal trend analysis
- Stakeholder-ready reporting

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**SSL Certificate Errors (Hugging Face downloads)**
```python
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
```

**Out of Memory (TensorFlow/Sentiment Analysis)**
- Reduce batch size in sentiment analysis
- Use smaller models (e.g., `distilbert-base-uncased`)
- Close other memory-intensive applications

**Slow Performance**
- MLM training: Use GPU if available, or reduce epochs
- Sentiment analysis: Already optimized with chunking and progress bars

## üìù Next Steps & Enhancements

**Potential additions to strengthen the portfolio:**

1. **Export visualizations**: Add HTML exports of key charts for non-technical viewers
2. **API deployment**: Wrap sentiment model in FastAPI for production demo
3. **Testing suite**: Add pytest tests for data processing functions
4. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated notebook execution
5. **Docker container**: Containerize for easy deployment
6. **Dashboard**: Streamlit/Dash app for interactive exploration
